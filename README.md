A simple Candy Shop Management web project for candy sellers built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **CrudCrud API**.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To digitize a candy shop's inventory by allowing sellers to add candies with details like name, description, price, and quantity. Sellers can also simulate purchases using "Buy 1", "Buy 2", or "Buy 3" buttons and automatically update quantities in real time.

  - Name

- "Buy 1", "Buy 2", and "Buy 3" buttons to simulate purchases and reduce stock.

- All data is stored in the cloud using [CrudCrud API](https://crudcrud.com).
- Responsive and clean UI using CSS.
